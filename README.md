vimrc
=====

My vim config.

Installation:
1. Clone repository to preferred location: `git clone https://github.com/gurgus/vimrc`
2. In the root of the project, run `git submodule init` then `git submodule update`
3. Symlink vimrc to ~/.vimrc and vim/ to ~/.vim
4. Open vim and execute the following: ':BundleInstall'
5. Enjoy!

Note: the current colour scheme (wombat256) requires 256 colour terminal
to be enabled client and server side or funky stuff will happen.
