vimrc
=====

My vim config.

Installation:
1) Clone repository to preferred location: git clone https://github.com/gurgus/vimrc
2) Symlink vimrc to ~/.vimrc and vim/ to ~/.vim
3) Open vim and execute the following: ":BundleInstall"
4) Enjoy!

Note: the current colour scheme (wombat256) requires 256 colour terminal
to be enabled client and server side or funky stuff will happen.
